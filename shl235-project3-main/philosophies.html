      <h4> Simplicity </h4>
        <p> "It all comes down to this: Let’s make it simple. Really simple."
        <p>Steve Jobs' love for simplicity is unmatched with anything else. Jobs understood our modern lives – filled with a cacophony of demands, relationships, and information, the capacity to create and communicate – are inherently complicated. Thus,anything you might come across that has been under the influence of Jobs, the idea is always present. Not just the products they have made, but take a look at one of the Apple product packagings that you might've kept or the <a href="https://www.apple.com/?afid=p238%7CseIEs444j-dc_mtid_1870765e38482_pcrid_545811415574_pgrid_13945964887_&cid=aos-us-kwgo-brand-apple--slid---product-">Apple Inc.</a>.Or how easy and simple it is to navigate and use different functions on your device. While it is easy to add elements to designs, sometimes the most success comes from removing everything that is a distraction.</p>

      <h4> Friendliness </h4>
        <p> "The broader one's understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have."
        <p> Friendliness is something inseparable from Apple and its products. Steve Jobs always emphasized the need for their products to empathize and connect with the users. So much so that in Apple's first iteration of Apple computer, a smiley face icon popped up when the computer turned on to approach the users in a more friendly manner. Apple has made cutting-edge devices seem friendly, a way for them to appeal to anyone intimidated by the complexity of a computer in the past. He believed good designs are based upon an detailed understanding of users, the tasks they want to carry out and the environment in which the tasks take place, not the other way around.

      <h4> Craft </h4>
        <p> "Quality is more important than quality. One home run is much better than two doubles." </p>
        <p> In all aspects of life, Steve Jobs took precision seriously. His level of detail has left a deep impression on designers, and his focus on craft has always been admirable. His accuracy in his art made sure that aesthetics were maintained at all times. Even if elements are hidden, Steve Jobs ensured that every single aspect is high-quality and attractive. With this precision, it is important to remember that people do judge a book by its cover and that quality should never be compromised.</p>

    <h3> Influences</h3>

      <h4> Childhood Home</h4>
        <p> Jobs' childhood home in Los Altos was built by famous modernist architecture Joseph Eichler. Largely known for his modernistic movement, Eichler's architecture mainly consists of large glass panels, minimalitic design, and modest lines. All of these elements are fully present in Apple's product design, corresponding to element of minimalism and simplicity. Above all, Eichler also placed emphasis on usability of his architecture, which is at the very core of Apple's every design approach. </p>

      <h4> Zen Buddhism </h4>
        <p> Jobs' love for simplicity was dramatized when he began practicing Zen Buddhism. He believed that the meditative practice that allowed him to expand his mind while simplifying down his thoughts. It was this philosophy that Jobs carried over not only into his lifestyle but also his design. The belief's influence on Jobs can be seen most prominently on his mouse design, where it took inspiration from Zen Buddhism's art form: enso. Lastly, Zen Buddhism also inspired Jobs' understanding of his audience. That is, to give them what they didn't know they needed.</p>

      <h4> Bauhaus Design </h4>
        <p> Bauhaus Design, an art school that was open in Germany that was initially opened with a goal to design practical objects that had both aesthetic and practical usage. This later became an art movement, which had an insurmountable influence on Steve Jobs. The key philosophy of Bauhaus Design,gesamtkunstwerk, meaning "total art of work," was a philosophy that Jobs implemented in all his creative undertakings. From, the material of the product to the design of the interface and even components such as the placement of circuits were meticulously considered and planned. Lastly, it was also from Bauhaus Design where Jobs was inspired to mainly use the color white, which was the total opposite of what other technology giants such as Sony were doing at the time by painting everything black.

      <h4> Father's Fence Building </h4>
        <p> During his time living in his Los Altos home with his parents, Jobs was one day asked to help out his father on building a fence around their house. Jobs' father asked him to make the back of the fence just as flawless as the front. Even though nobody will see the back, Jobs' father believed that it will show the dedication to making something perfect. Ever since then, Jobs was driven in making the computer beautiful both inside and out. This moment had a lasting impact on Jobs' endless pursuit of perfection — qualities that would come to define his career and success with Apple. </p>
